Q.1 Define vector

  A vector is a list of numbers. There are (at least) two ways to interpret what this list of
numbers mean: One way to think of the vector as being a point in a space. Then this list of numbers is a
way of identifying that point in space, where each number represents the vector’s component that
dimension. Another way to think of a vector is a magnitude and a direction, e.g. a quantity like velocity
(“the fighter jet’s velocity is 250 mph north-by-northwest”). In this way of think of it, a vector is a
directed arrow pointing from the origin to the end point given by the list of numbers.

Q.2 Explain numpy

  NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of
linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an 
open source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

Q.3 What is dot product?

  Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two 
sequences of numbers.
