Q.1) Define complex number.

 A complex number is combination of Real number and and Imaginary Number.

Q.2) Explain the following packages:
   A) numpy
    
     NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

   B) matplotlib

    Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.

Q.3) Define conjugate of a complex number.

 conjugate of a complex number has the same real component but the imaginary component is negated.

Q.4) Find the conjugate of z=3+2i
 
 The conjugate of z=3+2i is z=3-2i.
